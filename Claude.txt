Start an outbound call
Outbound calls can be automatically started for a User from their Phone app. It is often used to build a Click-to-call feature!

A Number ID and a phone number to dial must be provided in the request's body.

The User must be available, not on a call and associated to the Number.

Number must be active (validated), inactive numbers can be seen in the Aircall Dashboard.

 This feature is only available on Aircall Phone app on Desktop for now, not yet on iOS and Android.

 Please note, the API doesnâ€™t support multiple sessions. It is not recommended to use this API along with Aircall CTI or Web App when multiple tabs are open
